    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty white bean soup is made with creamy cannellini beans and flavored with garlic and thyme. It's one of my family's favorite soups. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 rib celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) cans white cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh spinach, rinsed and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium-low heat. Add onion and celery; cook and stir until tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic, and cook for 30 seconds, continually stirring.</li>
        <li>Stir in beans, chicken broth, pepper, thyme, and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove 2 cups of bean and vegetable mixture from soup; set aside.</li>
        <li>Blend remaining soup in small batches in a blender at low speed until smooth — it helps to remove the center piece of the blender lid to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Pour blended soup back into pot; stir in reserved beans.</li>
        <li>Bring soup to a boil, occasionally stirring. Stir in spinach and until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in lemon juice and remove from heat. Serve soup with freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
